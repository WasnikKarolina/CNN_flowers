# Flower Classification using a CNN Model built with TensorFlow

## Project overview
This project builds a deep learning image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. It trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset of flower images to classify them into categories. The model includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and optimization techniques. After training, it evaluates the model's performance and predicts the class of new images with confidence scores.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Flower Photos dataset provided by TensorFlow. It contains images of different flowers organized into subfolders.

## Enviroment 
This project is designed to be run in Google Colab.
